### Save Dump file
![Start Sentinel dongle dumper](/img/safenet/sentinel_dongle_dump.png)

If the dongle reading procedure was successful, a small file that has .BIN extension will be created. This file is called Dongle dump. It contains the information taken from your dongle by Dumper and enough to make dongle emulator for your hardware device.

Dump file is encrypted so it is impossible to read any information from that file for anyone else. All data received from you is kept strictly confidentially and will not be spread under any circumstances.

### Send us dump file
